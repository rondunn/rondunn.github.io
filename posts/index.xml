      <description>Customers ask for references when choosing a cloud data warehouse platform. Who else is using it, and at what scale? They often overlook a more useful and open alternative - the online technical reference.
I find that StackOverflow is a great place to explore the comparative challenges being faced by users of data warehouse platforms, and the depth to which those users are supported by its vendor and community.

      <description>I’ve lived the Microsoft data warehouse story through SQL Server, Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW), Application Platform System (APS), Azure SQL Data Warehouse, and Azure Synapse Analytics. I loved being part of Microsoft, and I’ve been fortunate to work with some great people and some wonderful customers from all over the world.
But you have to believe in your product. One morning I woke up and realised that the passion wasn&amp;rsquo;t there any more.</description>
